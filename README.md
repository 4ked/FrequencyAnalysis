# FrequencyAnalysis

The project is an elementary level word frequency analysis tool. For any given text file as input, the program will return the 10 most frequent letters, the 10 most frequent words, and the 10 most frequent words after subtracting the 573 most common words in the english language. Additionally, the frequency of these values will also be returned.

A number of well known books have been included in the /books directory to showcase the program at a glance.
